# Justine's Coding Challenge
 
In order to defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers,

I Promise that, to the best of my ability and judgement:

1. I will not produce harmful code.

2. The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure  to accumulate.

3. I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

4. I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

5. **I will share the secrets I learn in code to enrich others and inspire them to improve their lives through code as well.**
